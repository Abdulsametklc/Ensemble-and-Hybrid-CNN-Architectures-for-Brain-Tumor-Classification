# 🧠 Ensemble and Hybrid CNN Architectures for Brain Tumor Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a multi-model hybrid deep learning framework for brain tumor classification using MRI images.
Instead of relying on a single convolutional neural network (CNN), the study explores hybrid and ensemble-based
architectures by combining the strengths of multiple pretrained CNN backbones.

The main motivation is to improve classification accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance in medical
image analysis, where reliable diagnosis is critical.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design hybrid CNN architectures using multiple pretrained models
- Improve performance compared to single-model approaches
- Perform comprehensive evaluation using medical-relevant metrics
- Provide a reproducible and extensible deep learning pipeline
- Analyze the impact of feature fusion in brain tumor MRI classification

## 🧠 Hybrid Model Concept

### Why Hybrid Models?
Single CNN architectures may:
- Focus on limited feature representations
- Miss complementary spatial or semantic features
- Overfit on medical datasets

Hybrid models aim to:
- Capture multi-scale and multi-level features
- Combine global and local representations
- Improve robustness and generalization

---

### Hybrid Architecture Strategy
Each hybrid model follows a common strategy:
1. Multiple pretrained CNN backbones are used in parallel
2. Feature maps are extracted independently
3. Extracted features are fused (concatenation or merging)
4. Fully connected layers perform final classification

Pretrained models are primarily used as feature extractors,
with optional fine-tuning depending on the experiment.

### Example Hybrid Model Combinations
- EfficientNetB0 + ResNet50
- DenseNet121 + EfficientNetB0
- VGG16 + VGG19
- EfficientNetB3 + ResNet101
- Custom baseline model (KilicNN)

Each model is trained and evaluated independently
to ensure fair and consistent comparison.

### Key Architectural Components
- Pretrained CNN backbones
- Adaptive Average Pooling
- Feature concatenation
- Dropout for regularization
- Softmax output layer

## 🧪 Dataset
- Modality: Brain MRI
- Task: Binary classification (Tumor / No Tumor)
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Image resizing
  - Normalization
  - Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, etc.)

Due to GitHub file size limitations, large datasets
and trained model weights are hosted externally.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
To ensure reliable medical evaluation, the following metrics are used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall (Sensitivity)
- Specificity
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Cohen’s Kappa
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics provide both statistical
and clinical relevance.
